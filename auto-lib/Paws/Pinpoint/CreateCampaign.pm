Paws::Pinpoint::CreateCampaign - Arguments for method CreateCampaign on L<Paws::Pinpoint>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateCampaign on the
L<Amazon Pinpoint|Paws::Pinpoint> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateCampaign.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateCampaign.

As an example:

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
