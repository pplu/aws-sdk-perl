=head1 NAME

Paws::ServiceDiscovery::InstanceSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ServiceDiscovery::InstanceSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Attributes => $value, ..., Id => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ServiceDiscovery::InstanceSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Attributes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex type that contains information about the instances that you
registered by using a specified service.

C<AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_ID> attribute is specified, then the
C<AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4> attribute contains the primary private IPv4

=item AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS

If the service configuration includes C<HealthCheckCustomConfig>, you
can optionally use C<AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS> to specify the initial
status of the custom health check, C<HEALTHY> or C<UNHEALTHY>. If you
don't specify a value for C<AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS>, the initial status
is C<HEALTHY>.

=item AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME

For a C<CNAME> record, the domain name that Route 53 returns in
response to DNS queries, for example, C<example.com>.

=item AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4

For an C<A> record, the IPv4 address that Route 53 returns in response
to DNS queries, for example, C<192.0.2.44>.

=item AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6

For an C<AAAA> record, the IPv6 address that Route 53 returns in
response to DNS queries, for example,
C<2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345>.

=item AWS_INSTANCE_PORT

For an C<SRV> record, the value that Route 53 returns for the port. In
addition, if the service includes C<HealthCheckConfig>, the port on the
endpoint that Route 53 sends requests to.

=back
