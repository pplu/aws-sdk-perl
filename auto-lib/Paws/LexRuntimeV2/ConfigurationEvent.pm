=head1 NAME

Paws::LexRuntimeV2::ConfigurationEvent

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LexRuntimeV2::ConfigurationEvent object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClientTimestampMillis => $value, ..., WelcomeMessages => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LexRuntimeV2::ConfigurationEvent object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClientTimestampMillis

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The initial event sent from the application to Amazon Lex to configure
the conversation, including session and request attributes and the
response content type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientTimestampMillis => Int

A timestamp set by the client of the date and time that the event was
sent to Amazon Lex.


=head2 DisablePlayback => Bool

Determines whether Amazon Lex should send audio responses to the client
application. When this parameter if C<false>, the client application
needs to create responses for the user.


=head2 EventId => Str

A unique identifier that your application assigns to the event. You can
use this to identify events in logs.


=head2 RequestAttributes => L<Paws::LexRuntimeV2::StringMap>

Request-specific information passed between the client application and
Amazon Lex.

The namespace C<x-amz-lex:> is reserved for special attributes. Don't
create any request attributes for prefix C<x-amz-lex:>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResponseContentType => Str

The message that Amazon Lex returns in the response can be either text
or speech based on the C<responseContentType> value.

=over

=item *

If the value is C<text/plain;charset=utf-8>, Amazon Lex returns text in
the response.

=item *

If the value begins with C<audio/>, Amazon Lex returns speech in the
response. Amazon Lex uses Amazon Polly to generate the speech using the
configuration that you specified in the C<requestContentType>
parameter. For example, if you specify C<audio/mpeg> as the value,
Amazon Lex returns speech in the MPEG format.

=item *

If the value is C<audio/pcm>, the speech returned is audio/pcm in
16-bit, little-endian format.

=item *

The following are the accepted values:

=over

=item *

audio/mpeg

=item *

audio/ogg

=item *

audio/pcm

=item *

audio/* (defaults to mpeg)

=item *

text/plain; charset=utf-8

=back

=head2 SessionState => L<Paws::LexRuntimeV2::SessionState>




=head2 WelcomeMessages => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LexRuntimeV2::Message>]

A list of messages to send to the user.
