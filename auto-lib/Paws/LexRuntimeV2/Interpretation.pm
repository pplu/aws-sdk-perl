  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Intent => $value, ..., SentimentResponse => $value  });

  $result->Att1->Intent

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An intent that Amazon Lex determined might satisfy the user's
utterance. The intents are ordered by the confidence score.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Intent => L<Paws::LexRuntimeV2::Intent>

A list of intents that might satisfy the user's utterance. The intents
are ordered by the confidence score.


=head2 NluConfidence => L<Paws::LexRuntimeV2::ConfidenceScore>

Determines the threshold where Amazon Lex will insert the
C<AMAZON.FallbackIntent>, C<AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent>, or both when
returning alternative intents in a response. C<AMAZON.FallbackIntent>
and C<AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent> are only inserted if they are
configured for the bot.


=head2 SentimentResponse => L<Paws::LexRuntimeV2::SentimentResponse>

The sentiment expressed in an utterance.

When the bot is configured to send utterances to Amazon Comprehend for
sentiment analysis, this field contains the result of the analysis.
