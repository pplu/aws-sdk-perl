=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::ModifyEventSubscription - Arguments for method ModifyEventSubscription on L<Paws::RDS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ModifyEventSubscription on the
L<Amazon Relational Database Service|Paws::RDS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ModifyEventSubscription.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ModifyEventSubscription.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $rds = Paws->service('RDS');
    # To change event notification subscription settings
    # This example changes the specified setting for the specified event
    # notification subscription.
    my $ModifyEventSubscriptionResult = $rds->ModifyEventSubscription(
      {
        'Enabled'          => 1,
        'EventCategories'  => [ 'deletion', 'low storage' ],
        'SourceType'       => 'db-instance',
        'SubscriptionName' => 'mymysqleventsubscription'
      }
    );


Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/rds/ModifyEventSubscription>
