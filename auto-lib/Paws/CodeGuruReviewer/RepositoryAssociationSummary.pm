Paws::CodeGuruReviewer::RepositoryAssociationSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeGuruReviewer::RepositoryAssociationSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssociationArn => $value, ..., State => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeGuruReviewer::RepositoryAssociationSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssociationArn

in the I<AWS CodeStar Connections API Reference>.


=head2 LastUpdatedTimeStamp => Str

The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, since the repository
association was last updated.

Setting up pull request notifications. This is required for pull
requests to trigger a CodeGuru Reviewer review.

If your repository C<ProviderType> is C<GitHub>, C<GitHub Enterprise

repository to trigger CodeGuru Reviewer reviews. If you delete these
webhooks, reviews of code in your repository cannot be triggered.
