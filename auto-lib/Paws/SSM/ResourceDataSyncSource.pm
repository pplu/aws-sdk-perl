=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::ResourceDataSyncSource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::ResourceDataSyncSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AwsOrganizationsSource => $value, ..., SourceType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::ResourceDataSyncSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AwsOrganizationsSource

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the source of the data included in the resource data
sync.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AwsOrganizationsSource => L<Paws::SSM::ResourceDataSyncAwsOrganizationsSource>

Information about the AwsOrganizationsSource resource data sync source.
A sync source of this type can synchronize data from AWS Organizations.


=head2 EnableAllOpsDataSources => Bool

When you create a resource data sync, if you choose one of the AWS
Organizations options, then Systems Manager automatically enables all
OpsData sources in the selected AWS Regions for all AWS accounts in
your organization (or in the selected organization units). For more
information, see About multiple account and Region resource data syncs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/Explorer-resouce-data-sync-multiple-accounts-and-regions.html)
in the I<AWS Systems Manager User Guide>.


=head2 IncludeFutureRegions => Bool

Whether to automatically synchronize and aggregate data from new AWS
Regions when those Regions come online.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceRegions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The C<SyncSource> AWS Regions included in the resource data sync.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceType => Str

The type of data source for the resource data sync. C<SourceType> is
either C<AwsOrganizations> (if an organization is present in AWS
Organizations) or C<singleAccountMultiRegions>.
