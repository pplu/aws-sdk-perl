=head1 NAME

Paws::Amplify::StartDeployment - Arguments for method StartDeployment on L<Paws::Amplify>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method StartDeployment on the
L<AWS Amplify|Paws::Amplify> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method StartDeployment.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to StartDeployment.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $amplify = Paws->service('Amplify');
    my $StartDeploymentResult = $amplify->StartDeployment(
      AppId      => 'MyAppId',
      BranchName => 'MyBranchName',
      JobId      => 'MyJobId',        # OPTIONAL
      SourceUrl  => 'MySourceUrl',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $JobSummary = $StartDeploymentResult->JobSummary;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Amplify::StartDeploymentResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/amplify/StartDeployment>
