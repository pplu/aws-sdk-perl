=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoImportPolicy => Str

(Optional) When you create your file system, your existing S3 objects

Amazon FSx keeps your file and directory listing up to date as you add
or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket. C<AutoImportPolicy> can
have the following values:

=over

=item *

C<NONE> - (Default) AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only updates file and
directory listings from the linked S3 bucket when the file system is
created. FSx does not update the file and directory listing for any new
or changed objects after choosing this option.

=item *

C<NEW> - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports directory
listings of any new objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do not
currently exist in the FSx file system.

=item *

C<NEW_CHANGED> - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports
file and directory listings of any new objects added to the S3 bucket
and any existing objects that are changed in the S3 bucket after you
choose this option.
