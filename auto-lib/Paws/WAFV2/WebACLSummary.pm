=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::WebACLSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::WebACLSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::WebACLSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

High-level information about a WebACL, returned by operations like
create and list. This provides information like the ID, that you can
use to retrieve and manage a C<WebACL>, and the ARN, that you provide
to operations like AssociateWebACL.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the Web ACL that helps with identification.


=head2 Id => Str

The unique identifier for the Web ACL. This ID is returned in the
responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations
like update and delete.


=head2 LockToken => Str

A token used for optimistic locking. AWS WAF returns a token to your
get and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of
the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token,
you provide the token to operations like update and delete. AWS WAF
uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity
since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update
fails with a C<WAFOptimisticLockException>. If this happens, perform
another get, and use the new token returned by that operation.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the Web ACL. You cannot change the name of a Web ACL after
you create it.
