=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::GeoMatchStatement

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::GeoMatchStatement object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CountryCodes => $value, ..., ForwardedIPConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::GeoMatchStatement object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CountryCodes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A rule statement used to identify web requests based on country of
origin.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CountryCodes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of two-character country codes, for example, C<[ "US", "CN"
]>, from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 international
standard.


=head2 ForwardedIPConfig => L<Paws::WAFV2::ForwardedIPConfig>

The configuration for inspecting IP addresses in an HTTP header that
you specify, instead of using the IP address that's reported by the web
request origin. Commonly, this is the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header, but
you can specify any header name.

If the specified header isn't present in the request, AWS WAF doesn't
apply the rule to the web request at all.
