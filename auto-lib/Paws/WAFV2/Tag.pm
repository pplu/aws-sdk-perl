=head1 DESCRIPTION

A tag associated with an AWS resource. Tags are key:value pairs that
you can use to categorize and manage your resources, for purposes like
billing or other management. Typically, the tag key represents a
category, such as "environment", and the tag value represents a
specific value within that category, such as "test," "development," or
"production". Or you might set the tag key to "customer" and the value
to the customer name or ID. You can specify one or more tags to add to
each AWS resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

You can tag the AWS resources that you manage through AWS WAF: web
ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and regex pattern sets. You can't manage or
view tags through the AWS WAF console.
