=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::XssMatchStatement

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::XssMatchStatement object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FieldToMatch => $value, ..., TextTransformations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::XssMatchStatement object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FieldToMatch

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A rule statement that defines a cross-site scripting (XSS) match search
for AWS WAF to apply to web requests. XSS attacks are those where the
attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as a vehicle to
inject malicious client-site scripts into other legitimate web
browsers. The XSS match statement provides the location in requests
that you want AWS WAF to search and text transformations to use on the
search area before AWS WAF searches for character sequences that are
likely to be malicious strings.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FieldToMatch => L<Paws::WAFV2::FieldToMatch>

The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect. For more
information, see FieldToMatch.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TextTransformations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::WAFV2::TextTransformation>]

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that
attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
specify one or more transformations in a rule statement, AWS WAF
performs all transformations on the content of the request component
identified by C<FieldToMatch>, starting from the lowest priority
setting, before inspecting the content for a match.
