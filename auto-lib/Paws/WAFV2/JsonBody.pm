=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::JsonBody

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::JsonBody object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InvalidFallbackBehavior => $value, ..., MatchScope => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::JsonBody object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InvalidFallbackBehavior

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The body of a web request, inspected as JSON. The body immediately
follows the request headers. This is used in the FieldToMatch
specification.

Use the specifications in this object to indicate which parts of the
JSON body to inspect using the rule's inspection criteria. AWS WAF
inspects only the parts of the JSON that result from the matches that
you indicate.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InvalidFallbackBehavior => Str

What AWS WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the JSON body.
The options are the following:

=over

=item *

C<EVALUATE_AS_STRING> - Inspect the body as plain text. AWS WAF applies
the text transformations and inspection criteria that you defined for
the JSON inspection to the body text string.

=item *

C<MATCH> - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. AWS
WAF applies the rule action to the request.

=item *

C<NO_MATCH> - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

=back

If you don't provide this setting, AWS WAF parses and evaluates the
content only up to the first parsing failure that it encounters.

AWS WAF does its best to parse the entire JSON body, but might be
forced to stop for reasons such as invalid characters, duplicate keys,
truncation, and any content whose root node isn't an object or an
array.

AWS WAF parses the JSON in the following examples as two valid key,
value pairs:

=over

=item *

Missing comma: C<{"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}>

=item *

Missing colon: C<{"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}>

=item *

Extra colons: C<{"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}>

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> MatchPattern => L<Paws::WAFV2::JsonMatchPattern>

The patterns to look for in the JSON body. AWS WAF inspects the results
of these pattern matches against the rule inspection criteria.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MatchScope => Str

The parts of the JSON to match against using the C<MatchPattern>. If
you specify C<All>, AWS WAF matches against keys and values.
