=head1 NAME

Paws::ManagedBlockchain::Node

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ManagedBlockchain::Node object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ManagedBlockchain::Node object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration properties of a node.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the node. For more information about
ARNs and their format, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
in the I<AWS General Reference>.


=head2 AvailabilityZone => Str

The Availability Zone in which the node exists. Required for Ethereum
nodes.


=head2 CreationDate => Str

The date and time that the node was created.


=head2 FrameworkAttributes => L<Paws::ManagedBlockchain::NodeFrameworkAttributes>

Attributes of the blockchain framework being used.


=head2 Id => Str

The unique identifier of the node.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The instance type of the node.


=head2 LogPublishingConfiguration => L<Paws::ManagedBlockchain::NodeLogPublishingConfiguration>

Configuration properties for logging events associated with a peer node
on a Hyperledger Fabric network on Managed Blockchain.


=head2 MemberId => Str

The unique identifier of the member to which the node belongs.

Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.


=head2 NetworkId => Str

The unique identifier of the network that the node is on.


=head2 StateDB => Str

The state database that the node uses. Values are C<LevelDB> or
C<CouchDB>.

Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the node.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::ManagedBlockchain::OutputTagMap>

Tags assigned to the node. Each tag consists of a key and optional
value.
