=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTEvents::AnalysisResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTEvents::AnalysisResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Level => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTEvents::AnalysisResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Level

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the result of the analysis.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Level => Str

The severity level of the analysis result. Analysis results fall into
three general categories based on the severity level:

=over

=item *

C<INFO> - An information result informs you about a significant field
in your detector model. This type of result usually doesn't require
immediate action.

=item *

C<WARNING> - A warning result draws special attention to fields that
are potentially damaging to your detector model. We recommend that you
review warnings and take necessary actions before you use your detetor
model in production environments. Otherwise, the detector model may not
fully function as expected.

=item *

C<ERROR> - An error result notifies you about a problem found in your
detector model. You must fix all errors before you can publish your
detector model.

=back



=head2 Locations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTEvents::AnalysisResultLocation>]

Contains one or more locations that you can use to locate the fields in
your detector model that the analysis result references.


=head2 Message => Str

Contains additional information about the analysis result.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of the analysis result. Analyses fall into the following types
based on the validators used to generate the analysis result:

=over

=item *

C<supported-actions> - You must specify AWS IoT Events supported
actions that work with other AWS services in a supported AWS Region.

=item *

C<service-limits> - Resources or operations can't exceed service
limits. Update your detector model or request a limit adjust.

=item *

C<structure> - The detector model must follow a structure that AWS IoT
Events supports.

=item *

C<expression-syntax> - Your expression must follow the required syntax.

=item *

C<data-type> - Data types referenced in the detector model must be
compatible.

=item *

C<referenced-data> - You must define the data referenced in your
detector model before you can use the data.

=item *

C<referenced-resource> - Resources that the detector model uses must be
available.

=back
