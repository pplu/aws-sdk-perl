=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupRecommendationOption

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupRecommendationOption object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Configuration => $value, ..., Rank => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupRecommendationOption object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Configuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a recommendation option for an Auto Scaling group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Configuration => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupConfiguration>

An array of objects that describe an Auto Scaling group configuration.


=head2 PerformanceRisk => Num

The performance risk of the Auto Scaling group configuration
recommendation.

Performance risk is the likelihood of the recommended instance type not
meeting the performance requirement of your workload.

The lowest performance risk is categorized as C<0>, and the highest as
C<5>.


=head2 ProjectedUtilizationMetrics => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::UtilizationMetric>]

An array of objects that describe the projected utilization metrics of
the Auto Scaling group recommendation option.

The C<Cpu> and C<Memory> metrics are the only projected utilization
metrics returned. Additionally, the C<Memory> metric is returned only
for resources that have the unified CloudWatch agent installed on them.
For more information, see Enabling Memory Utilization with the
CloudWatch Agent
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/metrics.html#cw-agent).


=head2 Rank => Int

The rank of the Auto Scaling group recommendation option.

The top recommendation option is ranked as C<1>.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer>
