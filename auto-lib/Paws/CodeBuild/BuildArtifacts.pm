=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeBuild::BuildArtifacts

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeBuild::BuildArtifacts object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ArtifactIdentifier => $value, ..., Sha256sum => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeBuild::BuildArtifacts object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ArtifactIdentifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about build output artifacts.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ArtifactIdentifier => Str

An identifier for this artifact definition.


=head2 BucketOwnerAccess => Str




=head2 EncryptionDisabled => Bool

Information that tells you if encryption for build artifacts is
disabled.


=head2 Location => Str

Information about the location of the build artifacts.


=head2 Md5sum => Str

The MD5 hash of the build artifact.

You can use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm file
integrity and authenticity.

This value is available only if the build project's C<packaging> value
is set to C<ZIP>.


=head2 OverrideArtifactName => Bool

If this flag is set, a name specified in the buildspec file overrides
the artifact name. The name specified in a buildspec file is calculated
at build time and uses the Shell Command Language. For example, you can
append a date and time to your artifact name so that it is always
unique.


=head2 Sha256sum => Str

The SHA-256 hash of the build artifact.

You can use this hash along with a checksum tool to confirm file
integrity and authenticity.

This value is available only if the build project's C<packaging> value
is set to C<ZIP>.
