=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::SharePointConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::SharePointConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CrawlAttachments => $value, ..., VpcConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::SharePointConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CrawlAttachments

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides configuration information for connecting to a Microsoft
SharePoint data source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CrawlAttachments => Bool

C<TRUE> to include attachments to documents stored in your Microsoft
SharePoint site in the index; otherwise, C<FALSE>.


=head2 DisableLocalGroups => Bool

A Boolean value that specifies whether local groups are disabled
(C<True>) or enabled (C<False>).


=head2 DocumentTitleFieldName => Str

The Microsoft SharePoint attribute field that contains the title of the
document.


=head2 ExclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns. Documents that match the
patterns are excluded from the index. Documents that don't match the
patterns are included in the index. If a document matches both an
exclusion pattern and an inclusion pattern, the document is not
included in the index.

The regex is applied to the display URL of the SharePoint document.


=head2 FieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map Microsoft
SharePoint attributes to custom fields in the Amazon Kendra index. You
must first create the index fields using the C<UpdateIndex> operation
before you map SharePoint attributes. For more information, see Mapping
Data Source Fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html).


=head2 InclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns. Documents that match the
patterns are included in the index. Documents that don't match the
patterns are excluded from the index. If a document matches both an
inclusion pattern and an exclusion pattern, the document is not
included in the index.

The regex is applied to the display URL of the SharePoint document.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecretArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of credentials stored in AWS Secrets
Manager. The credentials should be a user/password pair. For more
information, see Using a Microsoft SharePoint Data Source
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/data-source-sharepoint.html).
For more information about AWS Secrets Manager, see What Is AWS Secrets
Manager
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html)
in the I<AWS Secrets Manager> user guide.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SharePointVersion => Str

The version of Microsoft SharePoint that you are using as a data
source.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Urls => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The URLs of the Microsoft SharePoint site that contains the documents
that should be indexed.


=head2 UseChangeLog => Bool

Set to C<TRUE> to use the Microsoft SharePoint change log to determine
the documents that need to be updated in the index. Depending on the
size of the SharePoint change log, it may take longer for Amazon Kendra
to use the change log than it takes it to determine the changed
documents using the Amazon Kendra document crawler.


=head2 VpcConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceVpcConfiguration>
