Paws::AppMesh::HttpGatewayRouteMatch

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppMesh::HttpGatewayRouteMatch object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Prefix => $value, ..., Prefix => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppMesh::HttpGatewayRouteMatch object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Prefix

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that represents the criteria for determining a request match.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Prefix => Str

Specifies the path to match requests with. This parameter must always
start with C</>, which by itself matches all requests to the virtual
service name. You can also match for path-based routing of requests.
For example, if your virtual service name is C<my-service.local> and
you want the route to match requests to C<my-service.local/metrics>,
your prefix should be C</metrics>.
