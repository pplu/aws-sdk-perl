=head1 NAME

Paws::AppMesh::VirtualGatewayHealthCheckPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppMesh::VirtualGatewayHealthCheckPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HealthyThreshold => $value, ..., UnhealthyThreshold => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppMesh::VirtualGatewayHealthCheckPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HealthyThreshold

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that represents the health check policy for a virtual
gateway's listener.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> HealthyThreshold => Int

The number of consecutive successful health checks that must occur
before declaring the listener healthy.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IntervalMillis => Int

The time period in milliseconds between each health check execution.


=head2 Path => Str

The destination path for the health check request. This value is only
used if the specified protocol is HTTP or HTTP/2. For any other
protocol, this value is ignored.


=head2 Port => Int

The destination port for the health check request. This port must match
the port defined in the PortMapping for the listener.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Protocol => Str

The protocol for the health check request. If you specify C<grpc>, then
your service must conform to the GRPC Health Checking Protocol
(https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeoutMillis => Int

The amount of time to wait when receiving a response from the health
check, in milliseconds.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UnhealthyThreshold => Int

The number of consecutive failed health checks that must occur before
declaring a virtual gateway unhealthy.
