=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTAnalytics::Datastore

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTAnalytics::Datastore object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Storage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTAnalytics::Datastore object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a data store.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The ARN of the data store.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

When the data store was created.


=head2 FileFormatConfiguration => L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::FileFormatConfiguration>

Contains the configuration information of file formats. AWS IoT
Analytics data stores support JSON and Parquet
(https://parquet.apache.org/).

The default file format is JSON. You can specify only one format.

You can't change the file format after you create the data store.


=head2 LastMessageArrivalTime => Str

The last time when a new message arrived in the data store.

AWS IoT Analytics updates this value at most once per minute for one
data store. Hence, the C<lastMessageArrivalTime> value is an
approximation.

This feature only applies to messages that arrived in the data store
after October 23, 2020.


=head2 LastUpdateTime => Str

The last time the data store was updated.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the data store.


=head2 RetentionPeriod => L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::RetentionPeriod>

How long, in days, message data is kept for the data store. When
C<customerManagedS3> storage is selected, this parameter is ignored.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of a data store:

=over

=item CREATING

The data store is being created.

=item ACTIVE

The data store has been created and can be used.

=item DELETING

The data store is being deleted.

=back



=head2 Storage => L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::DatastoreStorage>

Where data store data is stored. You can choose one of
C<serviceManagedS3> or C<customerManagedS3> storage. If not specified,
the default is C<serviceManagedS3>. You cannot change this storage
option after the data store is created.
