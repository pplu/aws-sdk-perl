=head1 NAME

Paws::IAM::UpdateAssumeRolePolicy - Arguments for method UpdateAssumeRolePolicy on L<Paws::IAM>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateAssumeRolePolicy on the 
L<AWS Identity and Access Management|Paws::IAM> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateAssumeRolePolicy.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateAssumeRolePolicy.

As an example:

  $service_obj->UpdateAssumeRolePolicy(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
