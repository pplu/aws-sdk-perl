=head1 NAME

Paws::SimpleWorkflow::StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SimpleWorkflow::StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Cause => $value, ..., WorkflowType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SimpleWorkflow::StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailedEventAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Cause

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides details of the C<StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed> event.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Cause => Str

  The cause of the failure. This information is generated by the system
and can be useful for diagnostic purposes.

If B<cause> is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED, the decision failed
because it lacked sufficient permissions. For details and example IAM
policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows.

=head2 Control => Str

  

=head2 B<REQUIRED> DecisionTaskCompletedEventId => Int

  The ID of the C<DecisionTaskCompleted> event corresponding to the
decision task that resulted in the C<StartChildWorkflowExecution>
decision to request this child workflow execution. This information can
be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back the cause of events.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> InitiatedEventId => Int

  The ID of the C<StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated> event
corresponding to the C<StartChildWorkflowExecution> decision to start
this child workflow execution. This information can be useful for
diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to
this event.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> WorkflowId => Str

  The C<workflowId> of the child workflow execution.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> WorkflowType => L<Paws::SimpleWorkflow::WorkflowType>

  The workflow type provided in the C<StartChildWorkflowExecution>
decision that failed.
