  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Cause => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SimpleWorkflow::ScheduleLambdaFunctionFailedEventAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Cause

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides details for the C<ScheduleLambdaFunctionFailed> event.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Cause => Str

  The cause of the failure. This information is generated by the system
and can be useful for diagnostic purposes.

If B<cause> is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED, the decision failed
because it lacked sufficient permissions. For details and example IAM
policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> DecisionTaskCompletedEventId => Int

  The ID of the C<DecisionTaskCompleted> event corresponding to the
decision that resulted in the scheduling of this AWS Lambda function.
This information can be useful for diagnosing problems by tracing back
the chain of events leading up to this event.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

  The unique Amazon SWF ID of the AWS Lambda task.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

  The name of the scheduled AWS Lambda function.
