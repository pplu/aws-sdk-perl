=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 B<REQUIRED> cause => Str

  The cause of the failure. This information is generated by the system
and can be useful for diagnostic purposes.

If B<cause> is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED, the decision failed
because it lacked sufficient permissions. For details and example IAM
policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> decisionTaskCompletedEventId => Int

  The ID of the C<DecisionTaskCompleted> event corresponding to the
decision task that resulted in the C<CompleteWorkflowExecution>
decision to complete this execution. This information can be useful for
diagnosing problems by tracing back the chain of events leading up to
this event.
