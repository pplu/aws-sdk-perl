=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::ServerSideEncryption

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::ServerSideEncryption object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EncryptionType => $value, ..., KmsMasterKeyId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::ServerSideEncryption object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EncryptionType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the server-side encryption settings for an
S3 bucket or S3 object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EncryptionType => Str

The server-side encryption algorithm that's used when storing data in
the bucket or object. If default encryption is disabled for the bucket
or the object isn't encrypted using server-side encryption, this value
is NONE.


=head2 KmsMasterKeyId => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or unique identifier (key ID) for the
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that's
used to encrypt data in the bucket or the object. If an AWS KMS CMK
isn't used, this value is null.
