=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about when a classification job was paused. For a
one-time job, this object also specifies when the job will expire and
be cancelled if it isn't resumed. For a recurring job, this object also
specifies when the paused job run will expire and be cancelled if it
isn't resumed. This object is present only if a job's current status
(jobStatus) is USER_PAUSED. The information in this object applies only
to a job that was paused while it had a status of RUNNING.

job run will expire and be cancelled if you don't resume it first.


=head2 JobImminentExpirationHealthEventArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Health event that Amazon
Macie sent to notify you of the job or job run's pending expiration and

23 days.
