=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::BucketServerSideEncryption

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::BucketServerSideEncryption object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KmsMasterKeyId => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::BucketServerSideEncryption object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KmsMasterKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the default server-side encryption settings
for an S3 bucket. For detailed information about these settings, see
Setting default server-side encryption behavior for Amazon S3 buckets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html)
in the I<Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KmsMasterKeyId => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or unique identifier (key ID) for the
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that's
used by default to encrypt objects that are added to the bucket. This
value is null if the bucket uses an Amazon S3 managed key to encrypt
new objects or the bucket doesn't encrypt new objects by default.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of server-side encryption that's used by default when storing
new objects in the bucket. Possible values are:

=over

=item *

AES256 - New objects are encrypted with an Amazon S3 managed key and
use Amazon S3 managed encryption (SSE-S3).

=item *

aws:kms - New objects are encrypted with an AWS KMS CMK, specified by
the kmsMasterKeyId property, and use AWS managed AWS KMS encryption
(AWS-KMS) or customer managed AWS KMS encryption (SSE-KMS).

=item *

NONE - New objects aren't encrypted by default. Default encryption is
disabled for the bucket.
