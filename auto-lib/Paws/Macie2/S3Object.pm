=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::S3Object

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::S3Object object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BucketArn => $value, ..., VersionId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::S3Object object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BucketArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about an S3 object that a finding applies to.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BucketArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket that contains the object.


=head2 ETag => Str

The entity tag (ETag) that identifies the affected version of the
object. If the object was overwritten or changed after Amazon Macie
produced the finding, this value might be different from the current
ETag for the object.

=head2 Path => Str

The path to the object, including the full key (name).


=head2 PublicAccess => Bool

Specifies whether the object is publicly accessible due to the
combination of permissions settings that apply to the object.


=head2 ServerSideEncryption => L<Paws::Macie2::ServerSideEncryption>

The type of server-side encryption that's used to encrypt the object.


=head2 Size => Int

The total storage size, in bytes, of the object.


=head2 StorageClass => Str

The storage class of the object.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Macie2::KeyValuePair>]

The tags that are associated with the object.


=head2 VersionId => Str

The identifier for the affected version of the object.
