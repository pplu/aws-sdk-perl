  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PublishClassificationFindings => $value, ..., PublishPolicyFindings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::SecurityHubConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PublishClassificationFindings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies configuration settings that determine which findings are
published to AWS Security Hub automatically. For information about how
Macie publishes findings to Security Hub, see Amazon Macie integration
with Security Hub
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/securityhub-integration.html)
in the I<Amazon Macie User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PublishClassificationFindings => Bool

Specifies whether to publish sensitive data findings to AWS Security

findings filter. The default value is false.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PublishPolicyFindings => Bool

Specifies whether to publish policy findings to AWS Security Hub. If
you set this value to true, Amazon Macie automatically publishes all
new and updated policy findings that weren't suppressed by a findings
filter. The default value is true.
