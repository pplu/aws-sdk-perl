=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::ListedUser

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::ListedUser object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., UserName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::ListedUser object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Returns properties of the user that you specify.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

Provides the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the user that you
want to learn about.


=head2 HomeDirectory => Str

Specifies the location that files are written to or read from an Amazon
S3 bucket for the user you specify by their ARN.


=head2 HomeDirectoryType => Str

Specifies the type of landing directory (folder) you mapped for your
users' home directory. If you set it to C<PATH>, the user will see the
absolute Amazon S3 bucket paths as is in their file transfer protocol
clients. If you set it C<LOGICAL>, you will need to provide mappings in
the C<HomeDirectoryMappings> for how you want to make Amazon S3 paths
visible to your users.


=head2 Role => Str

Specifies the role that is in use by this user. A I<role> is an AWS
Identity and Access Management (IAM) entity that, in this case, allows
a file transfer protocol-enabled server to act on a user's behalf. It
allows the server to inherit the trust relationship that enables that
user to perform file operations to their Amazon S3 bucket.


=head2 SshPublicKeyCount => Int

Specifies the number of SSH public keys stored for the user you
specified.


=head2 UserName => Str

Specifies the name of the user whose ARN was specified. User names are
used for authentication purposes.
