=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::EndpointDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::EndpointDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AddressAllocationIds => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::EndpointDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AddressAllocationIds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured
for your file transfer protocol-enabled server. With a VPC endpoint,
you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your
VPC. To control incoming internet traffic, invoke the C<UpdateServer>
API and attach an Elastic IP to your server's endpoint.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AddressAllocationIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach an Elastic
IP address to your server's endpoint.

This property can only be set when C<EndpointType> is set to C<VPC> and
it is only valid in the C<UpdateServer> API.


=head2 SecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of security groups IDs that are available to attach to your
server's endpoint.

This property can only be set when C<EndpointType> is set to C<VPC>.

You can only edit the C<SecurityGroupIds> property in the
C<UpdateServer> API and only if you are changing the C<EndpointType>
from C<PUBLIC> or C<VPC_ENDPOINT> to C<VPC>.


=head2 SubnetIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of subnet IDs that are required to host your server endpoint in
your VPC.

This property can only be set when C<EndpointType> is set to C<VPC>.


=head2 VpcEndpointId => Str

The ID of the VPC endpoint.

This property can only be set when C<EndpointType> is set to
C<VPC_ENDPOINT>.


=head2 VpcId => Str

The VPC ID of the VPC in which a server's endpoint will be hosted.

This property can only be set when C<EndpointType> is set to C<VPC>.
