=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::UpdateServer - Arguments for method UpdateServer on L<Paws::Transfer>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateServer on the
L<AWS Transfer for SFTP|Paws::Transfer> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateServer.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateServer.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $transfer = Paws->service('Transfer');
    my $UpdateServerResponse = $transfer->UpdateServer(
      ServerId        => 'MyServerId',
      EndpointDetails => {
        VpcEndpointId => 'MyVpcEndpointId',    # min: 22, max: 22; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      EndpointType            => 'PUBLIC',       # OPTIONAL
      HostKey                 => 'MyHostKey',    # OPTIONAL
      IdentityProviderDetails => {
        InvocationRole => 'MyRole',              # min: 20, max: 2048; OPTIONAL
        Url            => 'MyUrl',               # max: 255; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      LoggingRole => 'MyNullableRole',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ServerId = $UpdateServerResponse->ServerId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Transfer::UpdateServerResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/transfer/UpdateServer>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndpointDetails => L<Paws::Transfer::EndpointDetails>

The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured
for your SFTP server. With a VPC endpoint, your SFTP server isn't
accessible over the public internet.



=head2 EndpointType => Str

The type of endpoint that you want your SFTP server to connect to. You
can choose to connect to the public internet or a virtual private cloud
(VPC) endpoint. With a VPC endpoint, your SFTP server isn't accessible
over the public internet.

Valid values are: C<"PUBLIC">, C<"VPC_ENDPOINT">

=head2 HostKey => Str

The RSA private key as generated by C<ssh-keygen -N "" -f
my-new-server-key>.

If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP
server to a new AWS SFTP server, don't update the host key.
Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive.

For more information, see
"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/configuring-servers.html#change-host-key"
in the I<AWS SFTP User Guide.>



=head2 IdentityProviderDetails => L<Paws::Transfer::IdentityProviderDetails>

This response parameter is an array containing all of the information
required to call a customer's authentication API method.



=head2 LoggingRole => Str

A value that changes the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
that allows Amazon S3 events to be logged in Amazon CloudWatch, turning
logging on or off.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ServerId => Str

A system-assigned unique identifier for an SFTP server instance that
the user account is assigned to.
