=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::PredictiveScalingPredefinedScalingMetric

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::PredictiveScalingPredefinedScalingMetric object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PredefinedMetricType => $value, ..., ResourceLabel => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::PredictiveScalingPredefinedScalingMetric object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PredefinedMetricType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a scaling metric for a predictive scaling policy.

When returned in the output of C<DescribePolicies>, it indicates that a
predictive scaling policy uses individually specified load and scaling
metrics instead of a metric pair.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PredefinedMetricType => Str

The metric type.


=head2 ResourceLabel => Str

A label that uniquely identifies a specific Application Load Balancer
target group from which to determine the request count served by your
Auto Scaling group. You can't specify a resource label unless the
target group is attached to the Auto Scaling group.

You create the resource label by appending the final portion of the
load balancer ARN and the final portion of the target group ARN into a
single value, separated by a forward slash (/). The format of the
resource label is:

C<app/EC2Co-EcsEl-1TKLTMITMM0EO/f37c06a68c1748aa/targetgroup/EC2Co-Defau-LDNM7Q3ZH1ZN/6d4ea56ca2d6a18d>.

Where:

=over

=item *

app/E<lt>load-balancer-nameE<gt>/E<lt>load-balancer-idE<gt> is the
final portion of the load balancer ARN

=item *

targetgroup/E<lt>target-group-nameE<gt>/E<lt>target-group-idE<gt> is
the final portion of the target group ARN.

=back

To find the ARN for an Application Load Balancer, use the
DescribeLoadBalancers
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html)
API operation. To find the ARN for the target group, use the
DescribeTargetGroups
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTargetGroups.html)
API operation.
