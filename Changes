 - New: perls 5.10 and 5.12 are working after changing package syntax. They've been setup for
        travis testing. This should not be thought of as long term commitment to supporting such
        old perl versions, but at least it can be viewed as we'll know exactly when we stop
        supporting them (and that will be announced in the changelog). Thanks to ilmari for
        a 5.10 support PR)

 - Pass tests on MacOSX by Roger Pettett
 - BREAKING CHANGE: All API methods and attributes have been properly CamelCased. Before
   that, some services were being generated with method names and attributes starting with
   lowercase. For example, in CloudWatchLogs, method DescribeLogGroups would expect:
     limit => Int, logGroupNamePrefix => Str
   Now it expects
     Limit => Int, LogGroupNamePrefix => Str
   The affected services are CloudSearchDomain, CloudTrail, CloudWatchLogs, CodeCommit,
   CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, Support, SimpleWorkflow, Glacier, ECS, DirectConnect, 
   DeviceFarm, DataPipeline, Config. 

   This change also applies to never-released-to-cpan services: MarketplaceCommerceAnalytics,
   IoT, IoTData, Inspector.

 - loaded classes can be made immutable for better performance vs a bit more load time
 - services can be preloaded via Paws->preload (see examples/preload.pl)
 - Experimental Furl caller
 - Proper linking of documentation to appropiate classes
 - All classes now have doc (some innner shapes docs were not being generated) 
 - CloudFront methods had dates appended to them. Now all methods don't have the
   date appended, so anyone using CloudFront should be aware of that API change
 - New iterators for EC2 and Glacier
 - New caller: Paws::Net::FurlCaller. Uses Furl to do HTTP calls

 - S3 API update: Support for ServerSideEncryption 
 - KMS API update: New operations: CancelKeyDeletion ListRetirableGrants ScheduleKeyDeletion and docu update

   class that holds all endpoint information for all services.
 - Rename RegionalEndpointCaller role to EndpointResolver

 - Support for STS regional endpoint when used passing a region to $paws->service('STS', region => 'Desired region'). 
   $paws->service('STS') still uses the global sts.amazonaws.com endpoint
 - Paws::Credential::AssumeRole and Paws::Credential::STS support new sts_region attribute to select region. Default
   is to use the global region

0.09 25 Jun 2015 17:00:00
 - API updates from botocore until 2015-06-29
 - Difference between SQS message AttributeMaps and QueueAttribute maps (thnks codehead) 
 - Paws now returns structured exceptions (Paws::Exception) with information of errors from
   the APIs. The exceptions stringify so you don't have to worry about too much breakage. If you
   were parsing the error message from the exception, you should now use Paws::Exceptions accessors
   to get the already parsed information
 - Refactoring in the different callers to move functionalities only where needed
 - Endpoint resolution support (first version by Iñigo Tejedor)
 - SQS Maps are now working correctly (QueueMaps were ill defined). Thanks to codehead
 - Fix bug for JSONCaller: when response doesn't have a body, the operation would succeed, but an
   invalid json string exception was thrown
 - longs changed to Moose type Int, instead of Num (longs are 64 bit integers 
   in Java https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)
   Those Ints are passed to AWS as int() instead of Strings, because AWS APIs (CloudWatchLogs
   for example) isn't able to transform String to long (we get an API error)
 - Refactored the config attribute of the Paws class. Also documented what you can configure from
   the config, so now the "config" is official.
 - BugFix: some Map attributes in JSON APIs were incorrectly being created as Maps of Strings, instead of Maps of Objects.
   Affected APIs are: CloudSearchDomain, CloudWatchLogs, CognitoIdentity, Config, DataPipeline, DynamoDB, EMR, Kinesis
   MachineLearning, OpsWorks, S3 and StorageGateway.

 - The default CredentialProviderChain will now try to read an ini
   file in ~/.aws/credentials with the aws credentials
 - The Credential providers have been moved into Paws::Credential namespace
 - The role that all Credential Providers have to add is now Paws::Credential
2015-02-09
 - Paws->service and $aws->service no longer return a class that
   has to be constructed. Instead they return an INSTANCE of the
   class. Attributes for the constructor can be passed as the 
   subsequent parameters of ->service.
   A method class_for_service returns the service class in the "old"
   fashion
   ->service('X')->new(region => 'Y') is now
   ->service('X', region => 'Y')
   or
   ->class_for_service('X')->new(region => 'Y')

   The recommended one is ->service('X', region => 'Y')

 - Adding paginators broke lots of classes (not loading)
